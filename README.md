# picture-in-picture
Picture-in-Picture made its first appearance on the web in the Safari browser with the release of macOS Sierra in 2016. It made it possible for a user to pop a video out into a small floating window that stays above all others, so that they can keep watching while doing other things. Itâ€™s an idea that came from TV, where, for example, you might want to keep watching your Popular Sporting Event even as you browse the guide or even other channels.

In this project you can share a window of your choice to the Picture-in-Picture window.

## How it works
1. Open any video of your choice in a separate chrome browser 'Window' (Not 'Tab')
2. Make sure to full screen and play the video
3. Open the project Demo here https://martinapinky.github.io/picture-in-picture/
4. Select the 'Chrome Tab' tab and then click 'Share'
5. Finally, click the 'START' button. It's pretty easy!
